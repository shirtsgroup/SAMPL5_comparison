Dear Editors, 

We are submitting our manuscript "Lessons learned from comparing
molecular dynamics engines on the SAMPL5 dataset", by Michael
R. Shirts, Christoph Klein, Jason M. Swails, Jian Yin, Michael
K. Gilson, David L. Mobley, David A. Case, Ellen D. Zhong for
inclusion in the SAMPL5 Special issue of J. Comput. Aided Mol. Design
as an article.

This article details the conversion between different molecular
simulation input files for the SAMPL5 blind test, and the energy
comparison of these files. Energy comparisons are mostly good
agreement, but a few minor statistically significant differences (such
as errors arising from incorrect Columb's constant) are noted and
examined. We believe this is the first time that this many programs
have been compared after automated conversion, opening the door to new
large-scale simulation pipelines that use automated conversion between
molecular simulation file inputs.
