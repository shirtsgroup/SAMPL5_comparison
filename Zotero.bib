	abstract = {There is a significant need for improved tools to validate thermophysical quantities computed via molecular simulation. In this paper we present the initial version of a benchmark set of testing methods for calculating free energies of molecular transformation in solution. This set is based on molecular changes common to many molecular design problems, such as insertion and deletion of atomic sites and changing atomic partial charges. We use this benchmark set to compare the statistical efficiency, reliability, and quality of uncertainty estimates for a number of published free energy methods, including thermodynamic integration, free energy perturbation, the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) and its multistate equivalent MBAR. We identify MBAR as the consistently best performing method, though other methods are frequently comparable in reliability and accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that assumptions of Gaussian distributed errors in free energies are usually valid for most methods studied. We demonstrate that bootstrap error estimation is a robust and useful technique for estimating statistical variance for all free energy methods studied. This benchmark set is provided in a number of different file formats with the hope of becoming a useful and general tool for method comparisons.},

	abstract = {In simulations, molecular dispersion interactions are frequently neglected beyond a cutoff of around 1 nm. In some cases, analytical corrections appropriate for isotropic systems are applied to the pressure and/or the potential energy. Here, we show that in systems containing macromolecules, either of these approaches introduce statistically significant errors in some observed properties; for example, the choice of cutoff can affect computed free energies of ligand binding to proteins by 1 to 2 kcal/mol. We review current methods for eliminating this cutoff-dependent behavior of the dispersion energy and identify some situations where they fail. We introduce two new formalisms, appropriate for binding free energy calculations, which overcome these failings, requiring minimal computational effort beyond the time required to run the original simulation. When these cutoff approximations are applied, which can be done after all simulations are completed, results are consistent across simulations run with different cutoffs. In many situations, simulations can be run with even shorter cutoffs than typically used, resulting in increased computational efficiency.},

Compound 1b displays highest affinity toward most of the drugs studied. Containers 1a and 1b are broadly applicable and can be used to formulate a wider variety of insoluble drugs than was previously possible with cyclodextrin technology.

We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N log(N).

To this extent, we have created a tool, CHAMBER, which can take a CHARMM protein structure file (PSF), coordinate file (COR) and associated forcefield files, and convert these to an AMBER topology file (prmtop) and associated coordinate file (inpcrd). CHAMBER opens a conversion route which enables the simulation of CHARMM parameterized models using AMBER's PMEMD engine; thus providing improved serial efficiency as well as parallel efficiency over large numbers of CPUs. Significant effort has been expended in ensuring a true representation of the CHARMM force field in AMBER providing energies and forces that are the same to the limits of machine precision.

The use of the CHARMM36 force field (C36 FF) in different MD simulation programs can result in disagreements with published simulations performed with CHARMM due to differences in the protocols used to treat the long-range and 1-4 nonbonded interactions. In this study, we systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. A wide range of Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with varying acyl chain saturation and head groups. MD simulations of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus) obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data. AMBER compared least favorably with the expected membrane properties, which appears to be due to its use of the hard-truncation in the LJ potential versus a force-based switching function used to smooth the LJ potential as it approaches the cutoff distance. The optimal simulation protocol for each program has been implemented in CHARMM-GUI. This protocol is expected to be applicable to the remainder of the additive C36 FF including the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 AA, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 AA) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 AA, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 AA and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 AA and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. (29 refs.)},

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently--those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

This method defines a local region for each particle and describes the remaining region as images of the local region statistically distributed in an isotropic and periodic way, which we call isotropic periodic images. Different from lattice sum methods that sum over discrete lattice images generated by periodic boundary conditions, this method sums over the isotropic periodic images to calculate long-range interactions, and is referred to as the isotropic periodic sum (IPS) method. The IPS method is not a lattice sum method and eliminates the need for a reciprocal space sum. Several analytic solutions of IPS for commonly used potentials are presented. It is demonstrated that the IPS method produces results very similar to that of Ewald summation, but with three major advantages, (1) it eliminates unwanted symmetry artifacts raised from periodic boundary conditions, (2) it can be applied to potentials of any functional form and to fully and partially homogenous systems as well as finite systems, and (3) it is more computationally efficient and can be easily parallelized for multiprocessor computers. Therefore, this method provides a general approach to an efficient calculation of long-range interactions for various kinds of molecular systems.},

	abstract = {We show how thermodynamic properties of molecular models can be computed over a large, multidimensional parameter space by combining multistate reweighting analysis with a linear basis function approach. This approach reduces the computational cost to estimate thermodynamic properties from molecular simulations for over 130,000 tested parameter combinations from over 1000 CPU years to tens of CPU days. This speed increase is achieved primarily by computing the potential energy as a linear combination of basis functions, computed from either modified simulation code or as the difference of energy between two reference states, which can be done without any simulation code modification. The thermodynamic properties are then estimated with the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) as a function of multiple model parameters without the need to define a priori how the states are connected by a pathway. Instead, we adaptively sample a set of points in parameter space to create mutual configuration space overlap. The existence of regions of poor configuration space overlap are detected by analyzing the eigenvalues of the sampled states’ overlap matrix. The configuration space overlap to sampled states is monitored alongside the mean and maximum uncertainty to determine convergence, as neither the uncertainty or the configuration space overlap alone is a sufficient metric of convergence. This adaptive sampling scheme is demonstrated by estimating with high precision the solvation free energies of charged particles of Lennard-Jones plus Coulomb functional form with charges between −2 and +2 and generally physical values of σij and ϵij in TIP3P water. We also compute entropy, enthalpy, and radial distribution functions of arbitrary unsampled parameter combinations using only the data from these sampled states and use the estimates of free energies over the entire space to examine the deviation of atomistic simulations from the Born approximation to the solvation free energy.},

	title = {Scalable {Algorithms} for {Molecular} {Dynamics} {Simulations} on {Commodity} {Clusters}},
	abstract = {Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biomolecular systems often run for days to months, many events of great scientific interest and pharmaceutical relevance occur on long time scales that remain beyond reach. We present several new algorithms and implementation techniques that significantly accelerate parallel MD simulations compared with current state-of-the-art codes. These include a novel parallel decomposition method and message-passing techniques that reduce communication requirements, as well as novel communication primitives that further reduce communication time. We have also developed numerical techniques that maintain high accuracy while using single precision computation in order to exploit processor-level vector instructions. These methods are embodied in a newly developed MD code called Desmond that achieves unprecedented simulation throughput and parallel scalability on commodity clusters. Our results suggest that Desmond's parallel performance substantially surpasses that of any previously described code. For example, on a standard benchmark, Desmond's performance on a conventional Opteron cluster with 2K processors slightly exceeded the reported performance of IBM's Blue Gene/L machine with 32K processors running its Blue Matter MD code},

Fundamental measures of the interaction between molecule and aqueous phase, such as the transfer energy between gas phase and water or the energetic difference between two tautomers of a molecule in solution, remain nontrivial to predict accurately using current computational methods. SAMPL2 represents the third annual blind prediction of transfer energies, and the first time tautomer ratios were included in the challenge. Over 60 sets of predictions were submitted, and each participant also attempted to estimate the error in their predictions, a task that proved difficult for most. The results of this blind assessment of the state of the field for transfer energy and tautomer ratio prediction both indicate where the field is performing well and point out flaws in current methods.},

	shorttitle = {{TopoGromacs}},
	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation engines use a variety of different approaches for modeling molecular systems with force fields that govern their dynamics and describe their topology. These different approaches introduce incompatibilities between engines, and previously published software bridges the gaps between many popular MD packages, such as between CHARMM and AMBER or GROMACS and LAMMPS. While there are many structure building tools available that generate topologies and structures in CHARMM format, only recently have mechanisms been developed to convert their results into GROMACS input. We present an approach to convert CHARMM-formatted topology and parameters into a format suitable for simulation with GROMACS by expanding the functionality of TopoTools, a plugin integrated within the widely used molecular visualization and analysis software VMD. The conversion process was diligently tested on a comprehensive set of biological molecules in vacuo. The resulting comparison between energy terms shows that the translation performed was lossless as the energies were unchanged for identical starting configurations. By applying the conversion process to conventional benchmark systems that mimic typical modestly sized MD systems, we explore the effect of the implementation choices made in CHARMM, NAMD, and GROMACS. The newly available automatic conversion capability breaks down barriers between simulation tools and user communities and allows users to easily compare simulation programs and leverage their unique features without the tedium of constructing a topology twice.},
