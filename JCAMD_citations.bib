abstract = {MOTIVATION: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.

RESULTS: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.

AVAILABILITY: GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.

abstract = {The widespread popularity of replica exchange and expanded ensemble algorithms for simulating complex molecular systems in chemistry and biophysics has generated much interest in discovering new ways to enhance the phase space mixing of these protocols in order to improve sampling of uncorrelated configurations. Here, we demonstrate how both of these classes of algorithms can be considered as special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a well-studied scheme in the field of statistical inference in which different random variables are alternately updated from conditional distributions. While the update of the conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably generates correlated samples, we show how judicious updating of the thermodynamic state indices--corresponding to thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or alchemical coupling variables--can substantially increase mixing while still sampling from the desired distributions. We show how state update methods in common use can lead to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple, inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated for several common applications, including an alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling.},

abstract = {We present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). For modeling, we computed alchemical absolute binding free energies. These were blind tests performed prospectively on 13 diverse, previously untested candidate ligand molecules. We predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five would not; 11 of 13 predictions were correct at this level. The RMS error to the measurable absolute binding energies was 1.8 kcal/mol. In addition, we computed "relative" binding free energies for six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands: phenol and catechol. The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction was 2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand these results at atomic resolution, we obtained x-ray co-complex structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment was 2.0 A (diverse set), 1.8 A (phenol-derived predictions), and 1.2 A (catechol-derived predictions). We found that predicting accurate affinities and rank-orderings required near-native starting orientations of the ligand in the binding site. Unanticipated binding modes, multiple ligand binding, and protein conformational change all proved challenging for the free energy methods. We believe that these results can help guide future improvements in physics-based absolute binding free energy methods.},

The computed changes in configurational entropy are comparable in magnitude to the changes in mean potential plus solvation energy, and they result primarily from changes in the average width of the energy wells upon binding. A strong correlation is observed between the changes in configurational energy and configurational entropy upon binding, resulting in near-linear compensation analogous to classical entropy-enthalpy compensation.},

abstract = {Expanded ensemble methods, designed to sample a range of an order parameter lambda of interest, can be optimized to overcome the difficulties associated with traversing large free-energy barriers or rugged landscapes. The optimization strategy of Trebst et al. [Phys. Rev. E 70, 046701 (2004)] is based on finding suitable biasing weights for inter-lambda transitions that maximize the number of round trips that the system performs between the lower and upper lambda bounds. In this work, this optimized-ensemble methodology is extended by finding weights that minimize the mean round-trip time tau (between the lambda end states) for a Markovian walk. Applications are presented for an atomistically detailed model and for systems where one needs to sample a wide range of concentrations or compositions. A less rigorous method that implements a dual tau minimization (for both upward and downward trajectories) is found to be harder to converge but produce more round trips than a method based on a single tau minimization for all trajectories. While the proposed methods do not always minimize the true tau, they have performances that are either similar or better than those of the original optimized-ensemble method and provide useful information to characterize deviations from Markovian dynamics in the sampling of the lambda space.},

In this work, efficient expanded ensemble methods are described to overcome the lack of ergodicity that often plagues such molecular moves, wherein an arbitrary physical parameter Lambda is used to gradually couple and decouple a partial molecule to and from the system. In particular, we describe the use of (1) acceptance ratio methods for the robust estimation of free-energy changes associated with transitions between Lambda states of the partial molecule, (2) non-Boltzmann sampling of the probability density of Lambda states so that one can achieve either a flat histogram or an optimized histogram based on the maximization of round trips between the Lambda bounds, and (3) an approach to select suitable intermediate stages of the Lambda parameter that maximizes such round trips. The validity of the advocated methods is demonstrated by their application to two model systems, namely, the solvation of large hard spheres into a fluid of small spheres, and the mesophase formation of a block copolymer-homopolymer mixture.},

abstract = {Although the statistical thermodynamics of noncovalent binding has been considered in a number of theoretical papers, few methods of computing binding affinities are derived explicitly from this underlying theory. This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding affinities. It also permits several important points to be established. For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding, but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational, configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed, and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of solvent molecules explicitly.},

The inclusion complex of MV dication in CB[7] is stable thermodynamically and kinetically. The electrochemical study reveals that unlike beta-cyclodextrin, CB[7] prefers the charged species, MV dication (MV(2+)), and cation radical (MV(+)*) to the fully reduced neutral (MV(0) species as guests. Dimerization of MV(+)* is suppressed effectively by forming a stable complex with CB[7] in aqueous solution as confirmed by spectroelectrochemical experiments. Furthermore, the first redox process (MV(2+)/MV(+)*) of the MV(2+)-CB[7] complex occurs predominantly via the direct electron transfer pathway, whereas the second redox process (MV(+)*/MV(0)) occurs via both the direct and indirect pathway because of the low affinity of the fully reduced species MV(0) to CB[7].},

abstract = {An alchemical free energy method with explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations was applied as part of the blind prediction contest SAMPL3 to calculate binding free energies for seven guests to an acyclic cucurbit-[n]uril host. The predictions included determination of protonation states for both host and guests, docking pose generation, and binding free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration. We found a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.6 kcal mol(-1) from the reference experimental results, with an R(2) correlation of 0.51. The agreement with experiment for the largest contributor to this error, guest 6, is improved by 1.7 kcal mol(-1) when a periodicity-induced free energy correction is applied. The corrections for the other ligands were significantly smaller, and altogether the RMSE was reduced by 0.4 kcal mol(-1). We link properties of the host-guest systems during simulation to errors in the computed free energies. Overall, we show that charged host-guest systems studied here, initialized in unconfirmed docking poses, present a challenge to accurate alchemical simulation methods.},

However, if this is occuring when disappearing in both complex and solvent, shift should cancel out. Only reason it wouldn't cancel out if boxes were of different sizes, and we demonstrated no statistically significant effect of box volume on free energy change, even for large and highly charged ligands. Also, CB7 host is neutral, so if get same answer disappearing host, effect is not so large.},

In other words, enthalpy is the driving force behind the free energy of assembly. The hydrophobic effect engenders the possibility of (nominally) relying not on enthalpy but entropy to drive assembly. Towards this idea, we describe how template molecules can trigger the dimerization of a cavitand in aqueous solution, and in doing so are encapsulated within the resulting capsule. Although not held together by (enthalpically) strong and directional non-covalent forces, these capsules possess considerable thermodynamic and kinetic stability. As a result, they display unusual and even unique properties. We discuss some of these, including the use of the capsule as a nanoscale reaction chamber and how they can bring about the separation of hydrocarbon gases.},

abstract = {We present the design, synthesis via methylene bridged glycoluril tetramer building blocks, and charaterization of acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners that function as hosts for a wide variety of ammonium ions in water. The X-ray crystallographic characterization of the free host and its complexes with p-xylylenediamine and spermine establish the flexibility of the methylene bridged backbone of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners that allow them to adapt to the structural features of the guest. We find that the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners-with their four contiguous methylene bridged glycoluril units and two aromatic o-xylylene walls bearing CO(2)H substituents-bind to ammonium ions in buffered water with values of K(a) ranging from approximately 10(5) M(-1) to greater than 10(9) M(-1). Similar to the cucurbit[n]uril family of hosts, we find that increasing the concentration of metal cations in the buffer reduces the affinity of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congener toward guests by competitive binding at the ureidyl C horizontal lineO portals. Although the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners retain the ability to bind to ammonium ions with high affinity, they do so with lower selectivity than cucurbit[n]urils presumably do to the structural flexibility of the hosts. A methylene bridged glycoluril tetramer model compound that lacks the substituted o-xylylene walls is a much lower affinity host, which establishes the importance of these rings on the overall recognition behavior of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners. Overall, the results in this paper establish that acyclic cucurbit[n]uril receptors that contain four or more contiguous methylene bridged glycoluril units retain many of the excellent recognition properties of the cucurbit[n]uril family.},

abstract = {The factors affecting host-guest complexation between the molecular container compound cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and various guests in aqueous solution are studied, and a detailed complexation mechanism in the presence of cations is derived. The formation of the supramolecular complex is studied in detail for cyclohexylmethylammonium ion as guest. The kinetics and thermodynamics of complexation is monitored by NMR as a function of temperature, salt concentration, and cation size. The binding constants and the ingression rate constants decrease with increasing salt concentration and cation-binding constant, in agreement with a competitive binding of the ammonium site of the guest and the metal cation with the ureido carbonyl portals of CB6. Studies as a function of guest size indicate that the effective container volume of the CB6 cavity is approximately 105 A(3). It is suggested that larger guests are excluded for two reasons: a high activation barrier for ingression imposed by the tight CB6 portals and a destabilization of the complex due to steric repulsion inside. For example, in the case of the nearly spherical azoalkane homologues 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (DBH, volume ca. 96 A(3)) and 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO, volume ca. 110 A(3)), the former forms the CB6 complex promptly with a sizable binding constant (1300 M(-1)), while the latter does not form a complex even after several months at optimized complexation conditions. Molecular mechanics calculations are performed for several CB6/guest complexes. A qualitative agreement is found between experimental and calculated activation energies for ingression as a function of both guest size and state of protonation. The potential role of constrictive binding by CB6 is discussed.},

abstract = {We explored the possibility of improving the accuracy and precision of free-energy differences estimated via expanded ensembles by manipulation of the biasing weights. Three different weighing approaches were compared: the flat histogram (FH) method, the optimized ensemble (OE) method, and a method introduced in this work, denoted MinVar, which aims to explicitly minimize the expected variance. The performance of these three methods was tested for the simulation of chemical potentials in systems of symmetric diblock copolymers with chain lengths of either 10 or 4 beads, and a system of one large hard sphere of diameter 10 d immersed in a fluid of hard spheres of diameter d. In addition, the effect of the weighing method on the observed accuracy was investigated for different choices of macrostate staging and for both optimized and nonoptimized acceptance ratio methods for calculating free-energy differences. In the diblock copolymer systems, we found that the maximum attainable accuracy can be limited by correlations between the samples, causing the "real" observed variances to be much larger than the expected "ideal" ones. Hence, if the formal minimization of the variance, as aimed by the MinVar method, occurs at the expense of increasing the correlations in the data, the accuracy may actually decrease. Although maximizing the number of round trips between initial and final macrostates (as aimed by the OE method) was found to be directly related to data decorrelation, this only translates into increased accuracy if the correlations are the major source of errors in the free energy estimates. Finally, for the hard sphere system, we found that the MinVar method performs better than both the OE and FH methods even though the MinVar method in this case never completes a round trip, illustrating that maximizing the number of round trips for fixed computational cost does not necessarily lead to increased precision.},

For the trypsin challenge, none of the methods were able to accurately predict the experimental results. For the MM/GB(PB)SA and LIE methods, the rankings were essentially random and the mean absolute deviations were much worse than a null hypothesis giving the same affinity to all ligand. Glide scoring gave a Kendall's $\tau$ index better than random, but the ranking is still only mediocre, $\tau$ = 0.2. However, the range of affinities is small and most of the pairs of ligands have an experimental affinity difference that is not statistically significant. Removing those pairs improves the ranking metric to 0.4-1.0 for all methods except CLIE. Half of the trypsin ligands were non-binders according to the binding assay. The LIE methods could not separate the inactive ligands from the active ones better than a random guess, whereas MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA were slightly better than random (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, AUC = 0.65-0.68), and Glide scoring was even better (AUC = 0.79). For the first host, MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA reproduce the experimental ranking fairly good, with $\tau$ = 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, whereas the Glide scoring was considerably worse, with a $\tau$ = 0.4, highlighting that the success of the methods is system-dependent.},

However, even with this acceleration, we find that sufficient sampling requires substantially longer simulations than are used in many published protocols. To further accelerate convergence, we introduce a new method of configuration space decomposition by orientation which reduces required simulation lengths by at least a factor of 5 in the cases examined.

The present study uses the Mining Minima algorithm to study the physics of these extraordinary associations and to computationally test a new series of CB[7] ligands designed to bind with similarly high affinity. The calculations reproduce key experimental observations regarding the affinities of ferrocene-based guests with CB[7] and beta-cyclodextrin and provide a coherent view of the roles of electrostatics and configurational entropy as determinants of affinity in these systems. The newly designed series of compounds is based on a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core, which is similar in size and polarity to the ferrocene core of the existing series. Mining Minima predicts that these new compounds will, like the ferrocenes, bind CB[7] with extremely high affinities.},

Higher affinity guests demonstrate "less entropy loss per unit energy gain" (explains partly why bicyclooctanes higher affinity than ferrocenes).
Electrostatic interactions between host and guest strong, but also strong between guest and water.  Thus, electrostatics contribute little for these guests since desolvation penalty (pulling out of favorable coulombic interactions with water) offsets favorable approximately equivalent interactions with host.
Thus, vdw contribution dominates, likely due in part to ideal fit in pocket, as seen in later paper.  Longer chains on bicyclooctanes, even with higher charge lead to lower affinity because higher entropic penalty, but don't align as well with oxygens on host rim.},

abstract = {A dicationic ferrocene derivative has previously been shown to bind cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) in water with ultrahigh affinity ($\Delta$G(o) = -21 kcal/mol). Here, we describe new compounds that bind aqueous CB[7] equally well, validating our prior suggestion that they, too, would be ultrahigh affinity CB[7] guests. The present guests, which are based upon either a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane or adamantane core, have no metal atoms, so these results also confirm that the remarkably high affinities of the ferrocene-based guest need not be attributed to metal-specific interactions. Because we used the M2 method to compute the affinities of several of the new host-guest systems prior to synthesizing them, the present results also provide for the first blinded evaluation of this computational method. The blinded calculations agree reasonably well with experiment and successfully reproduce the observation that the new adamantane-based guests achieve extremely high affinities, despite the fact that they position a cationic substituent at only one electronegative portal of the CB[7] host. However, there are also significant deviations from experiment, and these lead to the correction of a procedural error and an instructive evaluation of the sensitivity of the calculations to physically reasonable variations in molecular energy parameters. The new experimental and computational results presented here bear on the physical mechanisms of molecular recognition, the accuracy of the M2 method, and the usefulness of host-guest systems as test-beds for computational methods.},

abstract = {The photophysical properties of the phenazine-based dye neutral red were investigated in aqueous solution in the presence of the macrocyclic host molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) using ground-state absorption as well as steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. The results are contrasted to those previously obtained for beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD; Singh et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2004, 108, 1465). Both the neutral (NR) and cationic (NRH+) forms of the dye formed inclusion complexes with CB7, with the larger binding constant for the latter (K = 6.5 x 10(3) M(-1) versus 6.0 x 10(5) M(-1)). This result differed from that for beta-CD, where only the neutral form of the dye was reported to undergo sizable inclusion complex formation. From the difference in binding constants and the pK(a) value of protonated neutral red in the absence of CB7 (6.8), an increased pK(a) value of the dye when complexed by CB7 was projected (approximately 8.8). This shift differed again from the behavior of the dye with beta-CD, where a decreased pK(a) value (ca. 6.1) was reported. The photophysical properties of both NR and NRH+ forms showed significant changes in the presence of CB7. Fluorescence anisotropy studies indicated that the inclusion complexes of both forms of the dye rotate as a whole, giving rotational relaxation times much larger than that expected for the free dye in aqueous solution. The thermodynamic parameters for the NRH+.CB7 complex were investigated in temperature-dependent binding studies, suggesting an entropic driving force for complexation related to desolvation of the cation and the removal of high-energy water molecules from the CB7 cavity.},

abstract = {We used the second-generation mining minima method (M2) to compute the binding affinities of the novel host-guest complexes in the SAMPL3 blind prediction challenge. The predictions were in poor agreement with experiment, and we conjectured that much of the error might derive from the force field, CHARMm with Vcharge charges. Repeating the calculations with other generalized force-fields led to no significant improvement, and we observed that the predicted affinities were highly sensitive to the choice of force-field. We therefore embarked on a systematic evaluation of a set of generalized force fields, based upon comparisons with PM6-DH2, a fast yet accurate semi-empirical quantum mechanics method. In particular, we compared gas-phase interaction energies and entropies for the host-guest complexes themselves, as well as for smaller chemical fragments derived from the same molecules. The mean deviations of the force field interaction energies from the quantum results were greater than 3 kcal/mol and 9 kcal/mol, for the fragments and host-guest systems respectively. We further evaluated the accuracy of force-fields for computing the vibrational entropies and found the mean errors to be greater than 4 kcal/mol. Given these errors in energy and entropy, it is not surprising in retrospect that the predicted binding affinities deviated from the experiment by several kcal/mol. These results emphasize the need for improvements in generalized force-fields and also highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of force-field parameters prior to evaluating different free-energy methods.},

Recent studies suggesting that available force fields may be a key source of error motivate the present study, which reports the first mining minima (M2) binding affinity calculations based on a quantum mechanical energy model, rather than an empirical force field. We apply a semi-empirical quantum-mechanical energy function, PM6-DH+, coupled with the COSMO solvation model, to 29 host-guest systems with a wide range of measured binding affinities. After correction for a systematic error, which appears to derive from the treatment of polar solvation, the computed absolute binding affinities agree well with experimental measurements, with a mean error 1.6 kcal/mol and a correlation coefficient of 0.91. These calculations also delineate the contributions of various energy components, including solute energy, configurational entropy, and solvation free energy, to the binding free energies of these host-guest complexes. Comparison with our previous calculations, which used empirical force fields, point to significant differences in both the energetic and entropic components of the binding free energy.

Low molecular weight receptors and their ligands--i.e., host-guest systems--represent valuable test-beds for such affinity prediction methods, because their small size makes for fast calculations and relatively facile numerical convergence. The SAMPL3 community exercise included the first ever blind prediction challenge for host-guest binding affinities, through the incorporation of 11 new host-guest complexes. Ten participating research groups addressed this challenge with a variety of approaches. Statistical assessment indicates that, although most methods performed well at predicting some general trends in binding affinity, overall accuracy was not high, as all the methods suffered from either poor correlation or high RMS errors or both. There was no clear advantage in using explicit versus implicit solvent models, any particular force field, or any particular approach to conformational sampling. In a few cases, predictions using very similar energy models but different sampling and/or free-energy methods resulted in significantly different results. The protonation states of one host and some guest molecules emerged as key uncertainties beyond the choice of computational approach. The present results have implications for methods development and future blind prediction exercises.},

abstract = {The displacement of perturbed water upon binding is believed to play a critical role in the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, but it is nontrivial to unambiguously define and answer questions about this process. We address this issue by introducing grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) onto a three-dimensional grid situated in the region of interest around a solute molecule or complex. Snapshots from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies, energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host's nonpolar cavity. Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions.},

abstract = {We use thermodynamic integration (TI) and explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to estimate the absolute free energy of host-guest binding. In the unbound state, water molecules visit all of the internally accessible volume of the host, which is fully hydrated on all sides. Upon binding of an apolar guest, the toroidal host cavity is fully dehydrated; thus, during the intermediate $\lambda$ stages along the integration, the hydration of the host fluctuates between hydrated and dehydrated states. Estimating free energies by TI can be especially challenging when there is a considerable difference in hydration between the two states of interest. We investigate these aspects using the popular TIP3P and TIP4P water models. TI free energy estimates through MD largely depend on water-related interactions, and water dynamics significantly affect the convergence of binding free energy calculations. Our results indicate that wetting/dewetting transitions play a major role in slowing the convergence of free energy estimation. We employ two alternative approaches-one analytical and the other empirically based on actual MD sampling-to correct for the standard state free energy. This correction is sizable (up to 4 kcal/mol), and the two approaches provide corrections that differ by about 1 kcal/mol. For the system considered here, the TIP4P water model combined with an analytical correction for the standard state free energy provides higher overall accuracy. This observation might be transferable to other systems in which water-related contributions dominate the binding process.},

The cationic form undergoes no significant complexation with beta-CD, but binds strongly with CB7 (Keq = 2.0 x 10(5) M(-1)), causing a large enhancement in fluorescence intensity and lifetime of the dye in the latter host. The strong and selective binding of AOH+ with CB7 is attributed to ion-dipole interactions involving the ureido carbonyl rims of CB7 and the charged AOH+. In contrast, the neutral AO form of the dye shows quite similar binding with both CB7 and beta-CD, but the binding constants are lower by more than two orders of magnitude compared to that of the AOH+-CB7 system. CB7 and beta-CD show a contrasting behavior in modifying the acid-base character of the dye, shifting its pKa by about 2.6 units upward and about 0.7 units downward, in the two respective cases. These divergent pKa shifts of the dye arise from the differential affinity of the two host molecules to encapsulate the protonated and neutral form of the dye.},

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

abstract = {The field of host-guest chemistry provides computationally tractable yet informative model systems for biomolecular recognition. We applied molecular dynamics simulations to study the forces and mechanical stresses associated with forced dissociation of aqueous cucurbituril-guest complexes with high binding affinities. First, the unbinding transitions were modeled with constant velocity pulling (steered dynamics) and a soft spring constant, to model atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. The computed length-force profiles yield rupture forces in good agreement with available measurements. We also used steered dynamics with high spring constants to generate paths characterized by a tight control over the specified pulling distance; these paths were then equilibrated via umbrella sampling simulations and used to compute time-averaged mechanical stresses along the dissociation pathways. The stress calculations proved to be informative regarding the key interactions determining the length-force profiles and rupture forces. In particular, the unbinding transition of one complex is found to be a stepwise process, which is initially dominated by electrostatic interactions between the guest's ammoniums and the host's carbonyl groups, and subsequently limited by the extraction of the guest's bulky bicyclooctane moiety; the latter step requires some bond stretching at the cucurbituril's extraction portal. Conversely, the dissociation of a second complex with a more slender guest is mainly driven by successive electrostatic interactions between the different guest's ammoniums and the host's carbonyl groups. The calculations also provide information on the origins of thermodynamic irreversibilities in these forced dissociation processes.},
annote = {Both steered molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling simulations are performed to remove B5 from CB7 and spermine from CB6.  The use of GBSA implicit solvent is validated against explicit solvent, and a stiff spring pulling constant is shown to be preferred over a weak pulling constant since it prevents the molecule getting stuck and then performing large jumps.
        
For CB7 and B5, electrostatics seem important at the beginning of pulling as guest nitrogens interact with carbonyl oxygens of the host.  At the rupture point, however, LJ and bonded interactions dominate as the bulky bicyclooctane of the guest forces its way through the portal of the host.
        
For spermine in CB6, the molecule is slender, and thus the two peak forces observed represent breaking of favorable electrostatic interactions at each conformation.},

abstract = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned "on" and "off." Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third, the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding (protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems is significantly reduced, from approximately 25,000 to 2500. The computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small ( approximately 1 kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies are generally in good agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations (within approximately 2 kcal/mol). The present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational, and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive and accurate.},

The complexation behaviour was investigated using (1)H NMR and UV-visible spectroscopy as a function of pH and the pK(a) values of the guest were observed to increase (DeltapK(a1) = 1.5 and DeltapK(a2) = 1.6) upon host-guest complex formation. The energy-minimized structures of the host-guest complexes with the cationic guests were determined and provide agreement with the NMR results indicating the location of the CB[7] over the central portion of the guest. The inclusion of the monoprotonated form of ranitidine slows the normally rapid (E)-(Z) exchange process and generates a preference for the (Z) isomer. The formation of the CB[7] host-guest complex greatly increases the thermal stability of ranitidine in acidic aqueous solution at 50 degrees C, but has no effect on its photochemical reactivity.},

Converged estimates of the standard binding free energies are obtained for these systems by employing techniques such as parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics, conformational reservoirs, and multistate free energy estimators.

Overall, average effective binding energies reproduce affinity rank ordering better than the calculated binding affinities, even though calculated binding free energies, which account for effects such as conformational strain and entropy loss upon binding, provide lower root-mean-square errors when compared to measurements. Interestingly, we find that binding free energies are superior rank order predictors for a large subset containing the most flexible guests.

The dependence of the stability constant on the nature of the guests indicates that hydrophobic and dipole-quadrupole interactions are responsible for the binding. The complexation-induced chemical shift changes in the guest proton resonances, coupled with energy-minimization calculations, suggest that the guests are located such that their dipole moment is aligned perpendicular with the quadrupole moment of the CB[7] host. The stability constants for acetone and acetophenone decrease in the presence of Na(+) or K(+) cations as a result of cation capping of the CB[7] portals.},

The essential idea is that the convergence of the relevant measure (e.g., the free energy derivative in thermodynamic integration) is monitored in the reverse direction starting from the last frame of the trajectory, instead of the usual approach, which begins with the first frame and goes in the forward direction. This simple change in the use of the simulation data makes it straightforward to eliminate the contamination of the averages by contributions from the equilibrating region. A statistical criterion is introduced for distinguishing the equilibrated (production) region from the equilibrating region. The proposed method, called reverse cumulative averaging, is illustrated by its application to the well-studied case of the alchemical free energy simulation of ethane to methanol.},

abstract = {The synthetic host cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) binds aromatic guests or metal complexes with ultrahigh affinity compared with that typically displayed in protein-ligand binding. Due to its small size, CB[7] serves as an ideal receptor-ligand system for developing computational methods for molecular recognition. Here, we apply the recently developed variational implicit-solvent model (VISM), numerically evaluated by the level-set method, to study hydration effects in the high-affinity binding of the B2 bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative to CB[7]. For the unbound host, we find that the host cavity favors the hydrated state over the dry state due to electrostatic effects. For the guest binding, we find reasonable agreement to experimental binding affinities. Dissection of the individual VISM free-energy contributions shows that the major driving forces are water-mediated hydrophobic interactions and the intrinsic (vacuum) host-guest van der Waals interactions. These findings are in line with recent experiments and molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. It is expected that the level-set VISM, with further refinement on the electrostatic descriptions, can efficiently predict molecular binding and recognition in a wide range of future applications.},
annote = {So pretty confusing, but here's what I got...

        
Used implicit solvent model called VISM, which for now requires host and guest molecules to be rigid (no fluctuations) because incorporates surface free energy and solvation boundaries into solvent model.  Also, when solve for solvation shell, can have two energy minimizing conformations of water surrounding the solute molecules.  Thus, to get both solutions, started simulations with either "loose" or "tight" solvation shells.  Found this mattered (you got two different solutions) for the host alone, but not for the complex.  This indicates that waters are very free to move in and out of the host when no ligand is bound, but solvation is essentially fixed when the ligand is bound.

        
Concerning binding free energy, found that surface energy of solvation and host-guest interactions strongly favor binding, while electrostatic vdW parts of the solvation free energy changes disfavor binding (see highlighted conclusion).},
